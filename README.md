# ShinyGeode

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ShinyGeode is an interactive and user-friendly interface for the
**geode** package. Via this interface, all of the spatial mapping and
analysis functions of geode are available through point-and-click,
drop-down menus, check-boxes and sliders. No R scripting is needed.

The purpose of ShinyGeode is to provide a low barrier interface that
benefits a wide range of users. It allows rapid interaction with spatial
data for identifying patterns, generating hypotheses, and informing
further investigation and analysis.

## Installation

In R, you can install ShinyGeode directly from the CPAC
[GitHub](https://github.com/cpacc/) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cpacc/geode") # install or update geode package
remotes::install_github("cpacc/ShinyGeode") # then install ShinyGeode interface
```
